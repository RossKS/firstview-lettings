          <h3>Tenancy Applications</h3>
            <p>Tenancy Applications are assessed based on satisfactory responses to enquiries about the applicants credit history. In addition, employers, bank and personal references will also be required to support the tenants application. In some circumstances, a guarantor may be required in order that the tenants application is acceptable.</p>
            <p>Credit history information is provided by specialised agencies who charge Firstview Lettings for this information. The charge for checking the applicants credit history is included in the <b>Application Fee</b>.</p>
            <p>Both tenant and landlord will be required to enter into an Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement with each other and which will be prepared by Firstview Lettings Ltd. Typically, such agreements have an initial minimum fixed term of 6 months duration. The preparation of an Inventory Schedule itemising the condition of the fixtures and fittings within the property is strongly recommended.</p>
            <p><b>Initial Payment</b> The tenant cannot be given the keys to a property for which a tenancy application is successful until the initial payment due to the landlord has been received by Firstview Lettings and has been cleared through the banking system. The initial payment is an amount equal to the first months rent plus a deposit bond of six weeks rent. The bond will be held by the Landlord as security against exceptional wear and tear or dilapidations in the condition of the property over the let period for which the tenant is responsible, and/or any other costs incurred by the Landlord which are the tenants responsibility under the agreement.</p>

          <h3>Tenant Introduction Services</h3>
            <p>Tenants for properties featured on the Firstview Lettings website will be identified primarily via this website. Other methods of advertising, such as newspaper adverts may be used from time to time but the intention of such advertising methods is to promote the existence of this website only, and not necessarily to advertise individual featured properties. Our <b>charge</b> therefore reflects the cost of providing this type of service.</p>
            <p>The suitability of the proposed tenant will be assessed based on acceptable credit references provided by specialised tenant referencing agencies. In addition, employers, bank and personal references will also be required to support the tenants application. In some circumstances, a guarantor may be necessary in order that the tenants application is acceptable.</p>

          <h3>Inventory Preparation Services</h3>
            <p>This option is an accessory to the Tenant Introduction service, whereby Firstview Lettings Ltd will also prepare an itemised inventory schedule of the fixtures, fittings and condition of the Landlords property. Our <b>charge</b> for this service varies depending on the type of property.</p>
            <p>The inventory is an important part of the tenancy agreement made between the landlord and the tenant as it provides them both with a record of the contents and condition of the landlords property at the outset of the tenancy. Each has a copy which has been signed by both parties so that the schedule is accepted as an accurate account.</p>
            <p>In case a dispute should arise with respect to any costs incurred by the landlord that are the tenants responsibility under the agreement, or a dispute regarding the condition of the landlords property and the amount of the deposit to be paid back to the tenant at the termination of the tenancy, an accurate inventory will provide a record for both parties to refer back to when trying to resolve the dispute.<p>

            <p>For a monthly <b>charge</b>, the service provided comprises property condition inspections and verifying the receipt of rent payments.</p>
            <p>If the Letting Management Service is not required at the commencement of the tenancy, this service option can be provided later if the Landlords circumstances change.</p>
